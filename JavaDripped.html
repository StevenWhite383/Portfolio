                I took a three week Software Development course with <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/" target="_blank">CodeNation</a> where the goals were to spend one week developing a Python-based text game, and one week coding a website using HTML and CSS. If you want to check out the game, you can find that <a href="./Programming/DragonSlayer.html" target="_blank">here</a>, but as for the website, look no further.
                <br><br>
                JavaDripped, being a play of words of 'JavaScript', was a website which was designed to market coffee towards coders. I got this idea as I heard coders often did not get enough sleep and coffee was practically a necessity in their line of work. After thinking of the pun "JavaDripped", I knew I had to go forward with the idea.
                <br>
                This was maybe the third website I had developed from scratch but it was the first one that I was truly proud of. The layout is arguably professional looking and it has all the elements of a real advertising website. However, since I only had a week to make it, and it was only my third website, I did not have time to add responsive styles so it only really works on a 1080p screen. Because of this, I implemented a popup which tells the user that this is the case. An imperfect solution, but a solution nonetheless.
                <br><br>
                I believe the website speaks for itself so please check it out using the link above. If you would like to see the code for the website, it can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/StevenWhite383" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
