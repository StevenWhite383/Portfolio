        <h3>About</h3>
        <p id="margin-bottom">
            This was created as my final project on my 3D Modelling course at university, and it is the first project in which I aimed for a <b>"hyper-realistic"</b> style. Creating this scene involved using both familiar and various new technologies. For example, for some of the textures, I made use of the <a href="https://www.poliigon.com/" target="_blank">Poliigon</a> plugin for Blender. This made finding and applying seamless textures easy and fast. Before this, I spent time making my own seamless textures and the supplementary maps which, while it was fun, took up a lot of my time. This was also my first experiment with using <b>particle systems</b>, which I used to create the dust particles where the light streams in from the windows. This detail is hard to see but, I think, adds a lot to the realism of the scene.
            <br><br>
            I learned a ton with this project: How to have an efficient workflow, how to plan and frame a scene, how to save time when creating a 3D scene, what to look out for in realistic renders, and much more.
            <br><br>
            If I were to remake this room, there is honestly quite a lot I would change. For starters, I would create an exterior for the room, so it is not just floating in space and the viewer can actually imagine what kind of world this is. I would also fix a lot of the sharp edges, such as on the rug, the pillar, and above the lights. For an extra layer of realism, I would add more dirt and dust to the places with ambient occlusion - These corners are never spotless in the real world so adding some grime can go a long way to improving the realism.
