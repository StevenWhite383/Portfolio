                This was another asset I made for the cyberpunk city, along with the neon assets. The scene our group was creating would be a hover-car driving down a road through a city. Because the road would be so close to the camera, I tried to make it as realistic as possible. I purposefully made it simple, however, as I wanted it to be seamlessly repeatable. Using the "Array" modifier in Blender, the user could increase how many sections of the road there was. I also mapped the road to a curve, meaning the user could shape the road however they liked very simply: They just needed to position the curve and increase the array modifier.

                The results were exactly what I had hoped for and, in my opinion, looked and worked great. For a video demonstration of what I mean, click <a href="https://youtu.be/TmLHT2jhM9E" target="_blank">here</a>!
