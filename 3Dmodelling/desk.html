                This was one of the first projects I ever did and as such, unfortunately, I only have the one image of it. I also do not know <i>when</i> I made it. Maybe sometime around 2013?
                <br>
                After wondering what I should model to test my skills, I decided: Why not model what is right in front of me? So after gathering a few reference images I got to work. The monitors were very simple; Just a few simple shapes glued together, not worrying about topology or real-world scale. The desk and mouse mat were a similar story. The first challenge was the keyboard - The keycaps specifically. Since I did not plan ahead, giving each key a slight curve to match my real-world keyboard (The Logitech G513) was actually surprisingly difficult. This was because some keys are longer than others. Something so simple caused me to lose so much time because I was lazy and tried to just copy-paste each key. With the slight differences in some keys, this lead to less-than-desireable results. Overall, however, it was not too bad.
                <br><br>
                The controller. My biggest challenge yet... At the time. I wish I had a close-up of this controller because it was quite tough to make. The handles especially caused a great deal of trouble thanks to their unusually unique shape.
                <br><br>
                This scene could be vastly improved with actual textures on the models and better lighting. This project taught me to plan my models before I start and that I really should work with real-world scale as much as possible. It was also a good lesson on modelling more organic looking, complex shapes. Maybe I will remake it someday - an updated desk model - and see how far I have come.
