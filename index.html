            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <h2>STEVEN WHITE</h2>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio. My name is Steven White and my biggest passion is computers. I love building them, fixing them, learning about
                the new technologies surrounding them and, of course, using them. 
                <br><br>
                I have been using computers daily for over 14 years and I have come to be experienced in various departments thanks to my <b>passion and quick learning</b>
                skills. As I started off playing games like Portal and Minecraft, at a young age I decided I want to be a game developer. After graduating from
                high school I went on to study Games Design where I graduated with a <b>Distinction*</b>; The highest grade available. During this time, I fell in love
                with 3D modelling and decided to study that at university. 3 short years later and I had attained a <b>Bachelor's Degree</b> in 3D Modelling and Animation.
                <br><br>
                Since completing my time in education, I have learned various different skills regarding the PC ecosystem. I have taken courses in programming and 
                cyber security, I have built, fixed and maintained serveral PCs, I have gained extensive knowledge in different Adobe and Office programs, I have
                spent countless hours in video editting software, and I have even tried my hand at using different operating systems such as Linux.
                <br><br>
