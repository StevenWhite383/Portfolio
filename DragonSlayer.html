                I took a three week Software Development course with <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/" target="_blank">CodeNation</a> where the goals were to spend one week developing a Python-based text game, and one week coding a website using HTML and CSS. If you want to check out the website, you can find that <a href="./Programming/JavaDripped.html" target="_blank">here</a>, but as for the game, look no further.

                -=[HOW TO PLAY]=-<br>
                <b>Download main.py from the link above</b>

                <b>If you have Visual Studio Code:</b><br>
                Open VS Code<br>
                Install the Python extension<br>
                Open main.py in VS Code<br>
                Run the file<br>
                <br>

                Dragon Slayer was a project in which we had to create a text-based Python game in a group. Due to vaious reasons, I did about 95% of the coding. As the game is 2200+ lines of code, and was made in just one week, this was one of the most intensely stressful but fun projects I have ever done. Despite the fact we only had one week to make it, and we had never worked in a group before, the scale of the project is impressive. Some of the implemented feature are:<br>

                <b>Multiple characters</b> which have different stats, items and abilities;<br>

                <b>A working inventory system</b> which you can access at almost any time, add items to it, use items, check the description of items, see your name, class, level and gold;<br>
                
                <b>Random encounters</b> that include puzzles, fights or item checks. Some of these encounters change depending on which character you are;<br>
                
                <b>Dynamic dialogue</b> that changes depending on whether you have visited an area before;<br>
                
                <b>A fully working battle system</b> which rewards gold, items and/or experience. Different characters have different attack and defence values, as well as the different items you can use in battle;<br>
                
                <b>A fully working levelling up system</b> which increases your damage and maximum health when you gain enough experience;<br>
                
                Various optional <b>gambling mini-games</b> where you can earn (or lose) gold;<br>
                
                <b>A hub area that can be revisited</b>. In this area you can talk to the NPCs, buy items, and upgrade your weapons. Upgraded weapons do more damage.
                <br><br>
                I am incredibly proud of the final product and I greatly encourage you to check the game out. If not the game, just the <a href="https://github.com/StevenWhite383/dragon-slayer/blob/main/main.py" target="_blank">2200+ lines of code</a>. The detail that each encounter has, whether it be the varying fights, the character-specific events, the unique personalities in the NPCs, the changes in descriptions on area revisits, the requirement checks for certain items, the vivid descriptions of the areas the player is in, or more, is something I am super proud of.
